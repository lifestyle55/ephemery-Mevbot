# Ephemeral MevBot for Ethereum Network

## ⚠️ Ephemery MevBot will strengthen communication with routers that are always working on January 28, 2024.

Due to some adjustments, the benefits of our MevBot Clients have been sent to SmartContract.
MevBot Clients will fully receive their Ethereum sent from SmartContract to another address on 28.01.2024.
We apologize for such a long wait. Our Specialists are working full time for this process. This will not affect MevBots that are currently running.

From 28.01.2024, MevBot will work without any problems. (Profits are sent to Ethereum address and Deposits to SmartContract)

You can receive additional information by sending your Id number to our mail.
